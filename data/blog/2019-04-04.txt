Sorry I have not been writing lately. Somehow it didn't exactly felt THAT long.
But I guess time flies when you are busy or disregarding time.
Before I knew it, its April! OMG! üò≤

Let's see where was I since my last blog post.
Ah, ok. In my last blog I mentioned that about 2018 being a year of gadgetry for me and mentioned that I got an Amazon Kindle Fire HD8. 
The other 2 gadgets that I got for 2018 are Lenovo Yoga 330-11IGM and a IPhone XS Max.

Hmm, ü§î I have to be honest here. 
The IPhone XS Max is more like a gift from my Dad (thanks Dad! üòÅ).
I am quite fond of my IPhone SE.
The only problems I have with IPhone SE are:

1. Battery - its starting to run out quicker and quicker after a charge.
2. Space capacity - 16 GB do tend to run out quickly since a good portion of it will be used by IOS. It does not help that pictures taken on IPhone tends to be quite large (especially if you want to retain the high resolution images for further editing or digital "darkroom" processes).

Using a IPhone XS does take some getting used to. 
I'm still adapting to it although I am more comfortable with it now.
Transiting from 4" to 6" screen is one thing.

Visually, its somewhat easy to adapt to the larger screen.
So much so that when you look back on the smaller 4" screen, it makes you think that there's something wrong with the SE. Until it hits you:

1.  Oh! The XS has a minimal bezel compared to the SE.
2.  The icons are more spaced out and more icons are on a single screen (because the length of the screen is long)
3.  The XS has no button; you reach the home page by swiping. SE uses a button.

The physical aspect of the IPhone XS is the part of the phone that requires more getting used to. Because its larger, its quite awkward to put in a pocket. 
So if you carry it in hand, you would then need to be more aware of where you are placing it (after all, its not exactly a cheap phone). 

In addition, the bigger screen also makes one-hand texting somewhat awkward. I also wish there's a way to adjust the font size to the smallness that I'm fond of. I preferred smaller font size, and the XS only allow customization up to certain degree.

I have to admit though, its nice looking at pictures using a larger screen. üòÅ

The space capacity is nice (a whopping 256 GB). It will take some time to run out unless I'm saving plenty of videos I think .

Yes, battery is newer and but I have the impression that applications that run on the new processor that comes with XS tends to eat up battery rather quickly too (depending on what applications you are running). 

Since I use limited number of applications, (I don't use any of the AR functionality) sometimes DO think that XS is wasted on me. Oh well, maybe its something that I will learn to capitalize on as this phone grows on me.
