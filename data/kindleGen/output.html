<h1>Kindle</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Kindle is a brand name from Amazon. 
It can represent either:</p>
<ol>
<li>electronic books that are files formatted in Amazon's proprietary formats (MOBI or KF)<br />
These are also known as Kindle ebooks.<br />
These files typically have the file extensions <code>.mobi</code> or <code>.kf8</code> for their respective format.</li>
<li>electronic devices for reading Kindle ebooks</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this section describes how one would make an Kindle ebook.</p>
<h2>Steps to make Kindle ebook</h2>
<p>The file format of a Kindle ebook is proprietary to Amazon.<br />
Hence, there is no easy way to generate one from scratch.<br />
Amazon does provide tools for authors to convert works in other document formats such as HTML and XHTML or ebook formats (such as <code>EPUB</code>, <code>FB2</code> or <code>XMDF</code>) into their <code>.mobi</code> format.</p>
<h2>Kindle format</h2>
<p>The <code>.mobi</code> format files was developed by Mobipocket SA for the MobiPocket Reader. The company was bought over by Amazon which adopted the format for their ebook reading devices.</p>
<p>The <code>.kf8</code> format is an enhanced version the <code>.mobi</code> format. It was intended to replace <code>.mobi</code>. It is backwards compatibility with most older generation of Amazon Kindle readers except for 1st &amp; 2nd Generation Kindle devices and Kindle DX.</p>

   This application takes in a <code>.docx</code> or <code>.pdf</code> file and convert it to Kindle format. Although this tool provides a user-interface, I do not find it to be user-friendly tool. I find myself spending a lot of time tweaking the file and then converting it and then to preview it.</p>
