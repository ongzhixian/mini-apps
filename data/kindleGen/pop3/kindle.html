<h1>Kindle</h1>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Kindle is a brand name from Amazon. 
It can represent either:</p>
<ol>
<li>electronic books that are files formatted in Amazon's proprietary formats (MOBI or KF)<br />
These are also known as Kindle ebooks.<br />
These files typically have the file extensions <code>.mobi</code> or <code>.kf8</code> for their respective format.</li>
<li>electronic devices for reading Kindle ebooks</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this section describes how one would make an Kindle ebook.</p>
<h2><a name="steps"></a>Steps to make Kindle ebook</h2>
<p>The file format of a Kindle ebook is proprietary to Amazon.<br />
Hence, there is no easy way to generate one from scratch.<br />
Amazon does provide tools for authors to convert works in other document formats such as HTML and XHTML or ebook formats (such as <code>EPUB</code>, <code>FB2</code> or <code>XMDF</code>) into their <code>.mobi</code> format.</p>
<h2><a name="kindle-format"></a>Kindle format</h2>
<p>The <code>.mobi</code> format files was developed by Mobipocket SA for the MobiPocket Reader. The company was bought over by Amazon which adopted the format for their ebook reading devices.</p>
<p>The <code>.kf8</code> format is an enhanced version the <code>.mobi</code> format. It was intended to replace <code>.mobi</code>. It is backwards compatibility with most older generation of Amazon Kindle readers except for 1st &amp; 2nd Generation Kindle devices and Kindle DX.</p>
<h2><a name="tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 conversion tools provided by Amazon to convert existing content into Kindle format.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200735480">Kindle Create</a>
   (<a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200735480">https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200735480</a>)<br />
   This application takes in a <code>.docx</code> or <code>.pdf</code> file and convert it to Kindle format. Although this tool provides a user-interface, I do not find it to be user-friendly tool. I find myself spending a lot of time tweaking the file and then converting it and then to preview it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId1000765211">KindleGen</a>

   This is a command-line tool takes in HTML document or existing ebooks in other formats (EPUB) and convert them to Kindle format. The rest of the </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using KindleGen, another useful tool would be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261">Kindle Previewer</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261">https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261</a>).<br />
This tool allows you to preview the <code>.mobi</code> file that was generated.<br />
Unfortunately, this tool is only available on Windows and MacOS.  </p>
<p>If you are using Kindle Create, you do not need Kindle Previewer (its packaged within the app).</p>
