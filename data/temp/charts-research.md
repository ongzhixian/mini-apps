Three years later the library landscape has changed a bit, and there are interesting and good new-comers:

    MetricsGraphics.js - built on top of D3.js and originally intended for Mozilla metrics dashboard, this library was made public for everyone. For some features it also needs jQuery though.
    
    C3.js - this one is also built on top of D3.js, but makes it so much easier to create charts than D3.
    
    Dygraphs - very simple charting library that allows users to explore and interpret dense data sets. Lots of features out of the box like highlighting individual values, zoom, not to mention that itâ€™s highly customizable.
    
    Cubism - a D3 plugin for visualizing time series. Use Cubism to construct better realtime dashboards, pulling data from Graphite, Cube and other sources.
