WHere to put script tag

https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup

Today, browsers support the async and defer attributes on scripts. These attributes tell the browser it's safe to continue parsing while the scripts are being downloaded.
async

<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" async></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" async></script>

Scripts with the async attribute are executed asynchronously. This means the script is executed as soon as it's downloaded, without blocking the browser in the meantime.

This implies that it's possible to script 2 is downloaded & executed before script 1. 
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" defer></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" defer></script>

Scripts with the defer attribute are executed in order (i.e. first script 1, then script 2). This also does not block the browser.

Unlike async scripts, defer scripts are only executed after the entire document has been loaded.
